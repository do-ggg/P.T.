        <h2>Introduction to Earth science P.T.</h2>
        
        <p>
            Our Planet Earth is home to various life forms, each ripples throughout the ECOSYSTEM they live in; may it be from the air, to the land, down to the sea. 
            We are known to be the higher form of species where our actions have a direct impact on the Earth, more specifically, on our planet’s major subsystems. 
            The four major subsystems have different functions but are all interconnected towards playing a vital role in the environment to promote a balanced, healthy, and sustainable home for ALL.
        </p>
        
         <section id="SS">
        <h2>Subsystem</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Task 1: Biosphere</h3></li>
            <p>One of the most significant subsystems is the biosphere or “Ecosphere”, which is made of all the components of Earth, which are living things that are found on the surface.
 
   It is essential to the ecosystem CONSIDERING THAT it fosters the need for survival, which requires living things to adjust to their local climate. It helps to maintain a healthy ecosystem, regulates Earth's climate, and maintains balance.</p>
            
            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220829155402/Biosphere.jpg">
            <li><h3>Hydrosphere</h3></li>
            <p> The hydrosphere makes up almost 70% of the earth's surface, it is linked to water and is essential to life. It contributes to climate regulations and supports the ecosystems, which keeps life on Earth alive. 
   It passes through a hydrological cycle, which includes other processes like condensation, evaporation, and precipitation.</p>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Watercyclesummary.jpg/393px-Watercyclesummary.jpg">
            <li><h3>Geosphere</h3></li>
            <p>The geosphere is made up of rocks, minerals, abiotic parts of soil, and fossilized remains. It has a role in processing the rock cycle, such as metamorphism, melting, solidification, weathering, erosion, deposition, and burial. 
   THE geosphere stretches from solid surface to the molten metallic core and reaches a depth of 6500 kilometers. It is essential for land organism, including humans, as weathering produces soil for plant growth and it is utilized for the extraction of minerals and elements.</p>
            <img src="https://www.sciencefacts.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Geosphere.jpg">
            <li><h3>Atmosphere</h3></li>
            <p>The outermost region of the earth is called the atmosphere. The existence of an atmosphere allows life to survive.
   This provides us with oxygen, shields us from UV rays, it retains heat, and keeps the temperature from falling. It facilitates the cycle of heat, and water, it is essential for chemicals and the climate system.</p>

        </ul>
        
        

 <section id="TT">
        <h2>Interactions</h2>
  <ul class="task-list">
                <li><p>The Biosphere is influenced by all the systems in the Earth. With the presence of the atmosphere, it receives sunlight and gas. It also collects water from the hydrosphere, and with the geosphere serves as a medium for living organisms on the surface.</p></li>
                <li><p>The Atmosphere interacts with the hydrosphere when a water cycle happens, like; evaporation. Once an evaporation occurs in the means of hydrosphere, it forms the foundation for clouds which serves as the formation of rain in the atmosphere. The water goes back into the hydrosphere in the form of rain.</p></li>
<li><p>The Hydrosphere interacts in maintaining the climate in the form of water cycling or known as hydrological cycle in other words.</p></li>
<li><p>The Geosphere interacts by the means of reflecting the sun’s energy back into the atmosphere. It also melts the ice and other bodies of water to flow back into the oceans or seas.</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            
            
 <section id="DD">
  <h2>Disruption</h2>
  <p> We perceive climate change as one of the ways that can devastate Earth completely. There are variety of issues that affect the subsystems, where all of which contribute to climate change. First, the production of greenhouse gases. It heavily impacts the atmosphere causing the ozone layer to slowly but surely shrink due to it. Another thing worth mentioning is that it could result in global warming, which would then affect the other subsystems severely. Like pollution which severely affects all the subsystems particularly with the Hydrosphere where the water is contaminated with toxic wastes affecting the aquatic ecosystem. The melting of ice caps also poses a huge threat to other systems which causes sea level to rise. The effects of global warming and exploitation of the Earth’s sOlid natural resources affects the geosphere like drought and forest fires. All of these affects all the subsystems but this is felt more by those in the Biosphere where in the destruction of land, pollution and global warming play a huge role in massive changes in our world.</p>
 
<ul class="task-list">
                <li><h3>Greenhouse Gases</h3></li>
                <li><h3>Shrinked Ozone Layer</h3></li>
                <li><h3>Global Warming</h3></li>
                <li><h3>Pollution</h3></li>
                <li><h3>Melting Ice Caps</h3></li>
                <li><h3>Rising Sea levels</h3></li>
                <li><h3>Drought</h3></li>
                <li><h3>Overall Impact</h3></li>
            </ul>
            
            
           
 
 <section id="CA">
 <h2>Call To Action</h2>
 <p>There are many ways to mitigate climte change without compromising our natural habitat, like renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, the protection and conservation of our biodiversity, the use of the reduce, re use, recycle policy,reduction of carbon emissions, and also plant more trees and other plants as they help in reducing carbon emissions and helps in reducing pollution. Another way to mitigat this is to educate the masses, on how to protect and care for the environment as well as encourage them to join or support programs that aim to help our environment. </p>
 
 
 <section id="CL">
     <h2>Climate Action</h2>       
            <p>As a human person we are responsible for our actions. We have the amount of knowledge to fully grasp that our actions extend throughout the environment, wrapping ecosystems and habitats including us in THREAT, both in long term and short term. In the eyes of the (usdg) United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals aims to disseminate all of the required standard goals needed to meet for  a balanced environment. We thrive for efforts to reduce the impact of climate change in our environment to promote a healthy and balanced safe place for all. Achieving Goal 13 (Climate Action) is merely not just an accomplishment but an eye opener for us where we provide contributions that could help in reducing the severity of climate change towards our surroundings expanding from a smaller area to a larger area benefitting those who inhabits that region. </p>
