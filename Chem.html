        <h2>Introduction to Chemistry P.T.</h2>
        
        <p>
            In our current society, pollutants have been a stagnant problem and a growing concern towards the environment, may it be; water, air or land. And in some cases, it has caused severe damage towards the environment leading to changes such as the water quality, soil quality and harmful chemicals that are released into the air that leads to the damages on the natural ecosystems threatening the biodiversity. </p>

<p>Certain products, like household cleaning products, contain chemicals that highly contribute to water pollution threatening both aquatic ecosystems and their habitat. However, the evaluation of the two product’s chemical composition can identify the components used. Additionally, analyzing the percentage composition of the products can determine its biodegradability and toxicity towards the aquatic environment. When choosing cleaning products, it is crucial to note what their environmental impacts are towards nature and how they influence the stability of the environment, specifically, marine life. </p>

<p>This will serve to meet Goal 14 – Life Below Water, one of the standard goals of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (USDG). It is to guarantee the protection of aquatic biodiversity, promoting its capability of a balanced development in conservation and sustainable use of oceans, sea and marine life. This report will serve as a recommendation to inform local governments, environmental advocacy groups and consumers who seek effective, safer and eco-friendly alternatives ensuring sustainable practices towards a balanced future for marine ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Products</h2>
<h3>Product: Zonrox</h3>
<p>Zonrox has different types of products. The one used for this comparison is the Zonrox Colour Safe Bleach, it is commonly used for laundry purposes like removing tough stains, dirt and odors while maintaining the colour of the fabric or cloth.</p>     
<h3>Product: Domex </h3>
<p>Zonrox has different types of products. The one used for this comparison is the Zonrox Colour Safe Bleach, it is commonly used for laundry purposes like removing tough stains, dirt and odors while maintaining the colour of the fabric or cloth.</p>  
       


<section id="Ca">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>According to our calculations, Zonrox Color Safe Bleach has less impact on the environment,
    specifically, on marine life. Due to its high composition of carbon and oxygen makes it a safer and an
    effective alternative use for household cleaning products considering that it contains the least
    harmful amount of chemicals compared to Domex. Note that carbon is also harmless if it’s not mixed
    with other compounds. Another thing worth mentioning is that Benzenesulfonic Acid, one of the
    active ingredients used in making Zonrox is considered a toxic substance but as research shows it is
    less toxic towards marine life than towards mammals.
    </p>
<p>On the other hand, Domex Disinfectant Toilet Cleaner is not recommendable due to the fact
    that this product contains high amounts of chlorine which in itself is harmful both in high and low
    amounts. It is also worth noting that the active ingredient for Domex is Hydrochloric acid is one of
    the most toxic and corrosive substances known to man and this toxicity stems from the acid having
    a very high pH, which is not an ideal substance to have in contact with water</p>
<p>Thus, Zonrox is the much safer option out of the two products since it is least harmful to the
    environment and applying proper utilization of the product would be an important step to make it
    an environment friendly product that could be used in the near future</p>
