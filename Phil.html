        <h2>Water Scarcity: The Dilemma of Agricultural Needs vs. Conservation</h2>
           <h3>By: Jorge Vincent B. Zalsos</h3>
        
        <p>
            In our current society, there are vast topics regarding various environmental issues where
            each one of these has a significant impact on our environment. It is crucial for us to acknowledge
            what our actions will and can do to our surroundings considering that it ripples throughout the
            environment. With balancing and establishing an ecological peace, it’s merely not just a goal, but
            an achievement towards for the betterment of our planet. However, despite such a positive mindset,
            these are difficult to achieve in a modern time that we are currently living in. From the increase of
            population, to the rapid growth of urbanization, global warming, climate change and any other
            factors that can directly pose a threat. Some of these could also result into dilemmas. That’s why
            we are responsible for these consequences because they are under our influences done with our
            human actions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The United Nations has set 17 Sustainable Development Goals specified for a type of issue,
one of which is the Goal 12 Responsible Consumption and Production aiming to imply that as a
human we should look for sustainable ways on how we can use our resources that minimizes its
impact on the environment. Water is among one of the most important substances on our planet
catering to various of life forms in diverse ecosystems and habitats such as forests and wetlands.
But nowadays, the use of our water is quite concerning for a fact that it has resulted into a rapid
depletion of water resources leading into scarcity. This dilemma is all about exploring ways on
how to conserve our water resources, but despite these solutions, it is also expected that the demand
for water on agricultural needs will also comprise. We have a lot of ethical principles that are
buried within ourselves and we can use these on how we can attain a quality of life, and at the
same time, it can also be done in aligning it with SDG 12 without the means of compromising our
surroundings in such a way that these principles are done with passion and sincerity where it can
be beneficial for all. According to the eye of consequentialism, it judges our actions whether if it’s
right or wrong under its consequences. Actions can be good or bad, but these are just the basis of
the results done with our decisions. With conserving water resources is one of the ways that we
can integrate one of our ethical principles since the conservation of water resources can benefit to
everyone and therefore it is a valid reason considering that we are experiencing an alarming rate
of depletion on our water resources. However, following the conservation of water resources
means that it can result into an increase of demand for agricultural purposes. These two falls under
the field of Jeremy Bentham who stated that all happiness is equal. And if in a logical sense, these
are our actions that Jeremy Bentham wants us to be aware of, conserving water and the increase
of demand is valid by the means of beneficiary to both situations bringing more satisfaction than
involving destructions
        </p>
        <p>
            There are quite a lot of insights that we can gain when we make our choices that varies
from one person to another. Such that if these choices are done directly towards our environment.
Making environmentally responsible choices is not just to serve, but it is a duty as a human person
on how we can analyze one problem thoroughly with the influence of our decisions. The personal
insights that I gained about making responsible choices for the environment helped me determine
if that these can benefit as a whole for those that involved with my choices. First, when we gather
passion and sincerity it can make our action fulfillable in a way that it can be done with full
potential. We can be able to examine how these environmental issues arise and what actions can
be taken to solve it immediately. Second, as I have mentioned above that whether if it can benefit
as a whole considering that our actions can sometimes led to foreshadowing so it is best to ensure
that it is assessed correctly. Third, since our actions are under our choices like collaboration for
example, we should measure it regardless of how small the contribution is as long as it can
encourage everyone to act this way. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In regards to my analysis, there are quite a lot of recommendations to be taken for achieving
sustainability. Proposing a program for example, it will make everyone gain additional
backgrounds to the arisen environmental issues just like what I have mentioned above that no
matter how small the contribution is as long as we can participate or collaborate to each other in
fulfilling ecological balance and peace. Education is also one of the most important factors to
achieve sustainability because aside from proposing a program, it is best to acknowledge what
education can do to us and there are a lot such as, (1) we are environmentally aware (2) we are
able to volunteer to any environmental projects and lastly, (3) we can be able to provide more room
in creating awareness about heavy environmental issues. Lastly, educational materials like books,
articles or journals can enhance our awareness towards the environmental issues that surrounds us.
We can relate these materials to what we are experiencing and how it is relevant to our today’s
society and sometimes these materials provide any beneficial tips to reduce our impact to the
environment. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our planet has already provided us with vast of natural resources, so these
recommendations can contribute in achieving the SDG 12 because in the eye of this development,
it can lessen the impact of what our actions can lead to the environment. With over 11 targets of
SDG 12, each one of these should be followed and taken seriously. Target 12.2 Sustainable
Management and Use of Natural Resources is one prime example, using our water resources
responsibly without compromising what is hidden under these body of waters can promote
harmonious balance between economic, social and environmental development. Following SDG
12 can be the gateway to reduce the depletion of water resources for more future generations to
come.

        <h2>The Dilemma of Deforestation and the Role of Responsible Consumption and Production in Promoting Ecological Peace</h2>
          <h3>  By: Kzathrea Venice P. Agbon</h3>

          <p>
            As we all know there are different types of environmental issues that we are currently facing
today, and one of those issues is deforestation. Deforestation is the process of cutting down or
clearing large areas of forests, usually to make space for farming, building, or other human
activities. This destroys trees and plants, which could lead to the loss of wildlife habitats and
reduces Earth's natural ability to absorb carbon dioxide, which contributes to climate change.
Though this environmental issue is quite common and mostly acted by humans, we can say that
this issue has a connection with sustainable consumption and production towards our
environment. Since, sustainable consumption and production focuses on the natural resources
that we humans deplete in order for us to have our basic needs. It's important to understand that
we must also not abuse the natural resources that we have because it might cause a negative
impact, not only towards our community but also our environment. In engaging in the operation
of deforestation, one would find themselves in a dilemma on whether they should do it for
economical development or halt it as it may harm the environment. They could choose to extract
natural resources for human needs and production but have a negative impact towards the
environment or to sustain the environment but have lesser natural resources which could create a
negative impact towards humans. This idea would lead one into an internal conflict where they
vary the consequences through their chosen actions.

        

          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to understand that every action we make always has consequences. As I have
            stated above, the act of deforestation can get one into a dilemma on whether they should do it for
            human needs or production but has a negative impact on the environment or to maintain the
            sustainability of the environment but has lesser production of natural resources and causes
            negative impact to humans. From what I've said above the dilemmas, that alone proves that there
            are pros and cons when it comes to deforestation. So to begin with, let's tackle the pros of
            deforestation to our environment and society, which according to what I've researched is that the
            clearance of forests can pave the way for agricultural expansion. This allows countries to
            increase food production or develop cash crops. Such land conversion can provide incentives for
            industries like farming which, in turn, can lead to job creation and boost local economies (Boyle,
            2024). To elaborate further, it is said that deforestation can also yield significant economic and
            social advantages. From creating jobs to boosting local economies and expanding agriculture,
            deforestation can unlock potential for development and growth in many regions. Next is the cons
            of deforestation, as we delve into the cons of deforestation, we know for a fact that this issue has
            a big negative impact towards our environment. Negative effects that we can consider would be
            the loss of trees and other vegetation which can cause climate change, desertification, soil
            erosion, fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, and a host of
            problems for Indigenous people (Ohlone, 2024). Through further analyzation, we can see that
            this is the cause of the loss of the natural resource such as the trees which has a great benefits
            towards us humans but this act of depletion of trees cause such imbalance towards our eco
            system which does not only harm the environment but also the habitats that lives in it. We must
            also consider that if we have lesser natural resources, we will get affected by this which can
            cause lack of production and sustainability towards our community.
            

          </p>
          <p>
            Now, Let's delve into the dilemma of deforestation regarding the act of depletion of
            natural resources, specifically deforestation for human needs and production. We all know that us
            humans are heavily reliant on natural resources in order for us to live and make a living out of it.
            As I have discussed, the products of deforestation are for the sake of human needs and to create a
            space for buildings, farming , and other human activities. We might think that this is an unethical
            act in the eyes of our ethics but we can confirm that this act is for the sake of human beings.
            Which is why we can really bring ourselves to ask sometimes, is it really unethical if the act is
            for the benefit of humans? In face of ethics, I'll say that it is unethical because even if we are
            doing it for the sake of ourselves and to help our own community, others are still harm by the
            actions that we did, such we can't really say that it is morally right, that is of course in my
            perspective. We can really see what the consequences will be if we continue to engage in these
            actions, that it does not only harm the environment, it can even cause the loss of natural
            resources. The other dilemma is to maintain the sustainability of our environment but humans
            will have lesser production and natural resources. Considering this dilemma, our environment
            will be protected and sustained, the resources would be limited but this actions has a big impact
            towards the lives of humans since we know that humans are heavily reliant on these resources,
            thus, we can say that this limited resources that we apply on the environmental change might
            improve the sustainability of our ecosystem but it could cause a huge conflicts for humans and
            possibly a war might even start because of the limited resources. Which in the eyes of ethics, can
            we really consider sustaining the environment if the impact is the conflict and lesser resources of
            humans? In my own perspective, it is important that we must really preserve the sustainability of
            our environment but we must also consider the life of humans since what is the use of these
            resources if they're only limited to certain people? In my morals it is definitely important to
            consider both sides before taking actions that will have varied consequences. Though, it is
            evident what will be the consequences if we apply these actions towards our environment, it
            causes human conflicts and loss of production.
          
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, we know that deforestation is a complex environmental issue with possibly
no solution, but we can also consider other methods in order for us to at least avoid abusing our
environmental resources. Because these actions are solely based on us, even small actions that
we do have big changes on our environment and ecosystem. So what I recommend is that we
must reduce our consumption of products driving deforestation, like paper and meat, and support
sustainable forestry practices like selective logging and reforestation. Strong laws and
community involvement in forest management are also crucial, while technology like satellite
imagery can monitor and enforce conservation efforts. Raising public awareness and educating
individuals about the importance of forests are essential to inspire change and support
sustainable practices. These activities that we imply can not only help the environmental
sustainability but also improve environmental health, it led us to perhaps disregard the dilemma
about deforestation between sustainability or the human needs. That these actions can help both
humans and the environment in order to promote ecological peace. As such, these
recommendations support the goals of Sustainable Development Goal 12, which focuses on
ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, by promoting responsible resource
management and reducing environmental impact. Encouraging sustainable land use and
responsible agricultural practices can minimize deforestation and habitat destruction, which
aligns with SDG 12’s objectives of efficient natural resource use and reducing degradation. By
implementing reforestation projects and stricter regulations, companies and communities are
taking actions to adopt sustainable consumption and production methods, fostering a culture of
environmental responsibility. This approach not only conserves ecosystems but also supports
livelihoods, contributing to a sustainable future that balances economic, social, and
environmental needs.

          </p>
          <p>
            To conclude, deforestation presents a complex dilemma that requires a delicate balance
            between economic development and environmental sustainability. While deforestation can bring
            short-term benefits such as agricultural expansion, increased land availability, and economic
            growth through job creation and resource extraction, these gains are outweighed by its long-term
            environmental consequences. The loss of forests accelerates climate change by reducing Earth’s
            natural ability to absorb carbon dioxide, leads to the destruction of wildlife habitats, disrupts
            ecosystems, and contributes to soil erosion and water scarcity. As a result, communities that rely
            on these forests for their livelihood and peoples who call these areas home suffer greatly. To
            address these challenges, it is crucial to adopt sustainable practices that prioritize both
            environmental conservation and human needs or welfare. Strategies such as promoting
            sustainable land use, and implementing reforestation efforts can help mitigate the damage, while
            technology like satellite monitoring can enhance forest management and avoid illegal logging
            activities. Moreover , it is equally important to reduce the consumption of products that drive
            deforestation, such as palm oil and certain types of meat, and supporting businesses that adopt
            sustainable sourcing methods. Engaging local communities in forest conservation, enforcing
            stricter regulations, and promoting education and awareness about the value of forests are critical
            steps toward fostering a culture of environmental responsibility. These measures align with the
            objectives of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12, which emphasizes the need for
            sustainable consumption and production patterns to ensure long-term ecological health and
            resource availability. By implementing a combination of these strategies or recommendations,
            society can work toward a sustainable future where economic development and environmental
            protection coexist, thereby securing the integrity of ecosystems and the well-being of future
            generations which we can ensure that always leads to ecological peace.

            <h2>Addressing Water Pollution through Ethical Consumptions</h2>
              <h3>  By: Karnela Shai C. Generalao</h3>

            <p>
                There are many discussions regarding the various environmental issues we face from time to time
and sometimes these discussions could turn into some interesting dilemmas and in this case, we
will look at a dilemma about water pollution and the ways to mitigate and control it. This dilemma
is quite an interesting one as this would also serve as a sustainable way for consumption and
production as reducing or at the very least would help lessen the dangers that come with water
pollution, especially with the waste we dump into our waterways. It is also worth mentioning the
benefits that come with reducing waste as well as reducing the consumption of our resources. As
stated above I will explain first what it means to be sustainable in both consumption and
production. This development goal pertains to our ability to find sustainable ways to improve our
quality of life by reducing the amount of resources we use on a day-to-day basis, hence why this
dilemma would fit well because it would take a look on how to mitigate water pollution and reduce
our waste production as well as reduce the amount of resources needed to make the products we
consume especially with products that require the use of water in its production
            </p>
            <p>
                As stated above, this dilemma could very fit well with the sustainable development goal number
twelve pertaining the sustainable consumption and production of resources. Another thing that I
did not mention is that this sustainable goal would be in line with the ethical principles considering
that these principles give an insight as to how we could attain a better quality of life. This is also
evident in SDG 12 since it deals with giving people better quality of life without the use of too
many resources and at the same time it does not comprise our day-to-day lives. This can also be
said the same with the ethical principles since it takes a look at how to provide a better life for the
people without compromising their morals and ethics. As such I will also discuss my insights on
making environmentally responsible choices especially when these choices have a huge ethical
impact on how we see and treat our environment. First, I learned that when making these choices
will always have to learn how to analyze whether it would be beneficial for us and the environment
or not. Second, it taught me that these choices could have many unforeseen implications if not
assessed properly. Lastly, when making these choices we must also consider the long-term effects
and whether it would be beneficial for us or not in the long run.

                Regarding my analysis, it would also be beneficial to give recommendations in lessening the
consumption or use of our resources to individuals, businesses, and the governing body as well.
First and foremost, education is a must if we want to have a sustainable life in regards to reducing
the use of resources since educating the masses would be beneficial and also help spread awareness
of the causes which in this case would be water pollution. Second, businesses should find ways to
cut down on the use of resources especially with the waste that they produce, the waste produced
by them could pose a threat to us considering their waste could add up to the pollution hence
reducing the quality of life for the masses. Third, government officials should implement programs
that would greatly benefit the environment and in the case of water pollution, they should find
ways to reduce the waste produced by businesses and find ways to make it efficient and the same
time lessen the consumption of resources. Lastly, aside from programs, there should also be laws
or even in this case policies that should be implemented to help the environment and the same time
improve the quality of life for the people without compromising our resources. It is also worth
mentioning that these recommendations would follow the SDG 12 goal of giving people a better
quality of life by reducing the consumption and production of our resources without compromising
our necessities. If followed these recommendations could potentially help save the environment,
give the people a better quality of living, and lessen environmental issues by reducing our use of
our resources to better our lives in the long run and prevent more issues from arising and at the
same time provide a sustainable future for us and for the future generations to come.

         <h2>Nature’s Advocates: WWF Philippines and the Fight for Biodiversity </h2>
              <h3> By: Bratislava Slovakia S. Benaojan </h3>
        <p>
            In this world full of cruelty and irresponsible people that do not logicalize their actions
            towards their surroundings which is the environment/whole world. Sustainable Consumption and
            Production (known as SCP) is about doing more and better with less. It is also about decoupling economic
            growth from environmental degradation, increasing resource efficiency and promoting sustainable
            lifestyles. SCP or Responsible Consumption and Production is a work towards a world of peace and
            prosperity, eradicating environmental issues such as overconsumption, habitat loss, energy waste, and
            food waste, all while protecting the planet. SCP is all about ensuring sustainable consumption and
            production patterns, which is key to sustain the livelihoods of current and future generations. This is an
            important key factor especially for everyone, because we all know that there are a lot of people who are
            becoming irresponsible even though they know that our environment lacks development and care.
            Responsible Consumption and Production is one of the best SDGs that we can apply or use when it comes
            to achieving a sustainable development and sustainable future for the environment.

            The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Philippines consists of four(4) main focuses
            which are the consumption, habitat, energy, and food. First aspect that they work to achieve their mission
            is consumption or what we called overconsumption, which means that in the economy, it involves
            households using resources like food, housing, and entertainment to meet their needs and wants, utilizing
            goods and services to satisfy their wants. It is the human practices that are progressively destroying the
            environment through overusing the world’s resources faster which affects the environment and global
            health or so called overconsumption. Second is Habitat, Habitat destruction is one of the biggest threats
            facing plants and animal species throughout the world. The loss of habitat has far-reaching impacts on the
            planet’s ability to sustain life, but even with the challenges, there is hope for the future. Habitat
            destruction, defined as the elimination or alteration of the conditions necessary for animals and plants to
            survive, not only impacts individual species but the health of the global ecosystem. Habitat loss is
            primarily, though not always, human-caused. The clearing of land for farming, grazing, mining, drilling,
            and urbanization impact the 80 percent of global species who call the forest home. Approximately 15
            billion trees are cut down each year. There are many reasons why energy crises occur. Many people in the
            world use energy as energy resources for homes, industries, and etc. The cause of energy crises includes
            overpopulation, infrastructure deterioration, waste of energy, and overconsumption of energy which are
            all causes of human activities. Overpopulation when people demand more energy resources to sustain
            their needs and that causes the overuse of energy resources. Infrastructure deterioration is when people
            insist that utilities like energy resources must raise their transportation system to sustain a dominant scale
            of energy resources, in short it is a general energy shortage. Waste energy is when people don't understand
            the importance of energy resources and they just want to maintain energy for themselves without even
            thinking about the consequences of their mindset that might affect the environment and continue to waste
            it. Overconsumption of energy or what we call overuse of renewable energy will usually cause
            greenflation or simply inflation to occur which mainly causes an increasing price of supplies because of a
            dominant level of demand but lack of supplies. Food shortage is mainly caused due to overpopulation,
            climate change that affects the soil quality, and food waste. Due to overpopulation, many people want to
            sustain their needs to feed themselves and that causes food production to run out of food supply. Due to
            climate change, the change of the living conditions of the environment and the people involved, and also
            the soil quality that is used to plant vegetables or foods. Food waste is when food is not consumed by
            humans and just thrown away without thinking that it can be used to recycle. Wasting food is like wasting
            the energy, water used to grow and all the important factors that are used to create and distribute all the
            foods in different places without even thinking about its benefits. The WWF or World Wide Fund for
            Nature Philippines track this kind of mission to combat the cause of overconsumption, habitat loss, energy
            waste, and food waste to have a better environment for the whole world and future generations.
        </p>

<p>
    WWF or World Wide Fund for Nature Philippines is one of the organizations that helps combat
    the environmental issues that occur in the philippines. The World Wide Fund for Nature helps protect,
    conserve, the habitats, consumption, energy, and food. They go around the world to help donate food and
    funds to the different environments to support them and make sure that they have a clean and safe
    environment, good habitats for all, energy that is enough to support their everyday needs of electricity,
    and enough supply of food. The World Wide Fund for Nature(WWF) Philippines promotes ecological
    peace to the environment through their efforts and work to sustainable development of responsible
    consumption and production. WWF-Philippines works to address the negative impacts of human
    consumption on the environment including pollution and waste. The "No Plastics In Nature" initiative has
    partnered with communities, cities, and government agencies all over the Philippines for projects that
    reduce the amount of plastics harming animals and ecosystems.
    
    

</p>
<p>
    According to WWF works, WWF-Philippines works to protect, conserve, and rehabilitate
    habitats across the country because they are the foundations upon which all of nature thrive. The human
    impact on habitats have been overlooked for many decades leading to extreme degradation in some
    ecosystems. Restoring habitats to become lush landscapes once again will greatly benefit entire
    communities that depend on it for their livelihood and also the biodiversity of life that call it home.
    WWF-Philippines works to accelerate the country's transition to renewable energy systems and to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption. Working closely with policymakers and
    governments on the national and local levels to tackle this challenge is part of our principle of "Together,
    Possible." WWF-Philippines works to ensure the sustainable production of food for all Filipinos. Food is
    vital to all life, but the severe effects of climate change increasingly threaten it. Drought, severe typhoons,
    and flooding are a few calamities that are expected to become more frequent because of global warming.
    Filipino farmers and fishers, already among the poorest in the country, face greater risks in growing food
    for the population.
    

</p>
<p>
    According to deontology, the work of WWF is ethical. Deontology is the rule and duty
    of a human person as universal law. Deontological ethics acknowledges that actions are morally
    independent of outcomes because good actions can result in bad outcomes and vice-versa. The World
    Wide Fund for Nature Philippines follows the rules and duty of their work as a human person as universal
    law that shows the actions towards achieving and promoting ecological peace and sustainable
    development as a responsibility of the human actions that caused the environment to get polluted all over
    the world. The WWF implies that working on this kind of mission with people, for people is to build a
    future where Filipinos live in harmony with nature, where ecological peace is present all over the
    philippines. Not only that, but it is also crucial to enhance the sustainability of the society, making the
    world to have a peaceful life in their surroundings. The work of WWF helps the people in the Philippines
    to prevent the different effects of climate change that cause bad air quality, lack of food production, and
    etc. It implies that it reverses the Philippine environmental issue into a more habitable environment. In
    order to determine whether the organization’s work or actions towards their mission is ethical, deontology
    also emphasizes the goodness of the purpose regardless of the action, despite the possible outcome of the
    actions/work. The dilemma shows the morality of deontology because of their actions to fulfill the world's
    needs. They also follow the SDG 12(Responsible consumption and production) that is associated with the
    meaning or focus of deontology as a human person. An action can only be moral if it has goodwill behind
    it and if the action is dutiful or necessary. Therefore, WWF or also known as World Wide Fund for Nature
    Philippines is ethically responsible for deontology’s definition and is suitable for promoting a sustainable
    development to the environment.

<p>
    Environmentally responsible choices create a better position or level in our environment
    which upholds and has a better understanding of our environment/whole world needs. The personal
    insights I have gained to become more environmentally responsible is that we, people, should be
    responsible for our actions towards the environment. We should think more of our actions towards our
    surroundings and be aware of our environment's condition because environmental issues are caused by
    human activities. We cannot protect and improve our environment without the human duty as a
    responsibility to what they have caused to the environment. There are many reasons why environmental
    issues happen which are all human activities. If all humans are not responsible for their actions, the
    environment and the people will live in a world full of immorality. The environment is not good if we let
    it go because there is nothing to change, nothing to improve the effect on the environment will worsen
    because of the actions of people who do not think about their bad actions towards the environment and the
    consequences that might also affect their lives. The pride and misbehavior of the human’s actions will get
    the environment to be in a bad condition because it will affect many aspects of our surroundings.
    Environmental issues are mainly caused by human activities and natural causes. It is our responsibility
    and duty to protect and improve our environment. Ethics and responsibilities towards the environment
    creates a fundamental principle based on ethical obligations to the environment. They shape our mindsets,
    actions and choices moulding how we treat and affect the environment. These duties and values promote
    stewardship along with the idea that we are meant to be responsible stewards of the Earth as conservators
    of resources and biodiversity for future generations. It means revering nature and recognizing the wonder
    of ecosystems and the rights of non-human beings. We are part of a web of life — what we do to one
    element in the environment has effects, often devastating cascading through all others. In this, the right to
    leave a livable and healthy planet, it demands responsible resource management and to refrain from
    making decisions burdened with more consequences for subsequent generations. In this regard, we require
    a type of moral revolution to be able to change human conduct for the benefit of the society.
    


</p>
<p>
    Based on the analysis, recommendations or suggestions that I would propose to
    individuals, businesses, or policymakers to encourage prudence and frugality in decision-making
    sustainability is that we should be more sensitive to our actions or what we do everyday as human beings
    and should think before doing such a thing if those actions will result in a negative outcome to our
    surroundings including the environment, the people that will be affected, and especially our individuals.
    Instead of wasting time, food, energy or strength, mind, plan, knowledge, and other human actions or
    being, we should value everything even if it is small things or big. It is like ensuring and moderating that
    all of our natural resources and human sources of information that are all being used carefully and
    mindfully as a collaboration and participation as responsibilities that we have everyday as a human person
    or human being. Everything we do, everything we act, and everything we think defines a person's
    behavior or character, universal law of human person’s duties and rules, and there are always
    consequences of our actions that focus on outcomes. Through ethical theory and environmental ethics, we
    learned how to value and be responsible for everything in our surroundings as who we are, what our
    purpose, and how we should act towards diversity. In individuals, we can encourage them to think wisely
    about their actions towards people, environment, etc even if it is small —adopt more sustainable lifestyles
    – this can involve consuming less, choosing products with lower environmental impacts, and reducing the
    carbon footprint of day-to-day activities. In businesses, we can encourage them to think wisely on how
    they should manage their business so that they don’t go bankrupt —a better understanding of
    environmental and social impacts of products and services is needed, both of product life cycles and how
    these are affected by use within lifestyles. In policymakers, we can encourage them through making
    decisions wisely of how they should decide what policy they should implement — making sure that it has
    a positive effect on the recipient. Through prudence and frugality, we can encourage the individuals,
    businesses, or policymakers to be more careful about their decisions or choices, and think first before
    doing it or acting. To be wise of their decision making.
    
   

</p>
<p>
    These recommendations contribute to achieving the goals of SDG 12 and promoting a
    sustainable future through wise decision making. In terms of achieving the goals of SDG 12 and
    promoting a sustainable future, we can easily say that being wise about our decisions or choices can avoid
    the negative effect that might affect the overall factors of human living and the environment. Encouraging
    them to be more careful of their own decisions in life can create or change their mindset to be more
    responsible that will surely benefit their way of living. It is like we have to think first if this decision can
    surely benefit them or if these actions can achieve the SDG 12 which is responsible consumption and
    production and promotes a sustainable future. Even if it is a job, business, environment, and all factors in
    our surroundings and human living. Prudence and frugality can also help people to think critically and
    value small things that contribute to achieving goals like SDG 12 and promoting a sustainable future. On
    what is the best way to do as individuals, businesses and policymakers in achieving SDG 12 and
    promoting a sustainable future —which guides us to have a better understanding of a proper method with
    alignment to the environment needs for sustainable development. WWF or World Wide Fund for Nature
    Philippines as duties and responsibilities of human person through having prudence and frugality of an
    action and mind in terms of decision making that is moral to achieve the goals of SDG 12 and promotes
    sustainable future — a good outcome that benefits the majority. Therefore, WWF is the best method in
    terms of showing responsible consumption and production that has prudence and frugality to combat
    environmental issues to be more wise in decision making which also shows the principle of ethics helping
    each other and educating one’s self to have a good consequences/outcome that benefits the overall factors
    of human living.

    <h2>A Call for Sustainable Consumption and Production Amidst to The Global Arsenic Problem </h2>
         <h3> By: Lady Erika V. Barinque </h3>
<p>
    Have you come across this odd and difficult situation like dilemmas that can make us
wonder how would we be able to decide which is the best way in choosing the right
course of action, even though they both have positive and negative impact to our
environments prompting ethical consideration and action, furthermore the world faces
urgent ecological challenges which we are in need to promote ecological peace in order
to maintain prosperity to our society and to our environments which needs conservative,
economical and frugal principles to handle this particular scenario. Through the guidance
of the SDG 12 calls for responsible consumption and production, fundamentally severing
economic growth from unsustainable resource use, emission and be able to improve the
management of hazardous substance. One of the goals include implementation of the
10-Year Framework of Programs on Sustainable Consumption and Production, efficient
management and use of natural resources, cutting various types of waste, and
responsible management of wastes and chemicals. It also calls for adoption of
sustainable practices in companies and in public procurement. This case we can be able
to correlate SDG 12 on how the ethical principle can help us lead the path in deciding and
making the right decisions.
</p>
<p>
    Across the globe, approximately 140million people are at risk of consuming arsenic
contaminated water, so as we keep on dwelling with this environmental dilemma about
the arsenic consumption and production. The global dilemma of arsenic contamination
appeared to be, significant environmental issues that connects to the sustainable
development Goal 12(SDG 12) which place a big role on producing and consuming goods
responsibly. Arsenic is a notoriously toxic heavy metal that is also present in nature and
throughout our environments, where it can pose a major threat or risk to public health.
Through this there is a possibility that it can contaminates food and water sources,
especially rice and cereals. The issue of ensuring access to food and water that is free
from arsenic contamination still not sufficient. Through the principle of justice demands
that all individual have access to food and safe drinking water, with focusing on
populations that are particularly vulnerable and impacted by exposure to arsenic.
Transparency in food production is necessary for ethical consumption, as industry is
prioritizing the public health over profitable production by utilizing the arsenic in
manufacturing glass, pigments, textiles, paper, metal, adhesives, wood preservatives and
ammunitions. By abiding by these guidelines, nations can create policies that safeguard
the environment and advance social justice, making sure no one is left behind in the
pursuit of sustainability. So as the industries dependent on mineral extraction and
agricultural production depend on our economy, ethical implications of this contamination
force us to balance health and safety above all else. Participation is essential to
addressing arsenic contamination and achieving SDG 12. Justice requires that everyone,
especially those who reside in developing countries where the majority of this
environmental crisis is occurring, have equal access to food and water that is free of
arsenic. Besides adequate governance, which places restrictions on the amount of
arsenic in consumables, sufficiency emphasizes that each and every person has a right
to an adequate supply of resources for their health and well-being.
</p>
<p>
    By trying to integrate
the ethical principles with SDG 12 these demonstrate the ethical value of justice,
sufficiency, solidarity. Justice necessitates ensuring equal access to arsenic-free water
and food for all individuals, particularly those in developing countries who bear the brunt
of this environmental crisis. Sufficiency emphasizes that every person has the right to
adequate resources for health and well-being, alongside effective governance that
imposes limits on arsenic levels in consumables. Through solidarity, global partnerships
can prioritize communities most affected by arsenic, fostering a cooperative approach to
remediation efforts. Lastly, participation calls for the inclusion of local voices in monitoring
water safety and advocating for change, thus empowering communities to protect their
own health. It demonstrated that consequentialism is the foundation of environmental
ethics. A consequentialist approach would assess practices and policies in the context
of arsenic contamination based on how well they reduce exposure and enhance public
health outcomes would give top priority to measures that solve the problem of arsenic
contamination and benefit the greatest number of people. 
</p>
<p>
By trying to Reflect the
implications of arsenic contamination has underscored the importance of our
environmentally responsible choices. By prioritizing locally sourced, organic products, we
can be able to reduce the risk of consuming harmful chemicals and support ethical
businesses committed to sustainable practices. It is essential to advocate for stringent
regulations on industries that contribute to pollution, this means that by launching
evaluated larger-scale efforts, such as public awareness campaigns, legislative
modifications, and community engagement, that can cumulatively lower the levels of
arsenic in drinking water and food supplies. Through concentrating on policies that result
in noteworthy improvements in health, interested parties synchronize their activities with
consequentialist views. Through Adopting these suggestions will encourage more
responsible resource management and healthier consumption habits, which will be very
helpful in achieving the SDG 12's objectives. We can reduce arsenic contamination and
foster a sustainable culture that prioritizes environmental integrity and human health by
combining ethical consumption with efficient production methods. To sum up this case
the arsenic problem highlights the urgency in providing sustainable consumption and
production practices that prioritize health and environmental wellness. By correlating the
ethical principles and a consequentialist approach, we can minimize the arsenic pollution
while improving health outcomes. Access to food and clean water depends on the
combined efforts of citizens, companies, and lawmakers who uphold moral goods and
advocates stricter regulations. So every tiny action counts toward ecological peace and
sustainable future generations.
